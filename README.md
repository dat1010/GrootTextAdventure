This is a simple text adventure game written for Groot.

The master branch is the code that needs refactored into Single Responsibility 

This project is for a presentatin/demo at work to show how we can use Encapsulation(commands and queries)
to better understand the Single Responsibility Principle. 

There are two branches to this project
  - SRP,  this branch shows basic refactoring
  - moreSRP, this branch shows how we can break up code into new classes once we have determed thier responsibilty.
